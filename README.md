# Dynamic Metronome
Dynamic Metronome is an Android metronome application that allows for easy programming of tempos. Even people who do not know how to write code can program this metronome. Designed first and foremost as a learning tool for me, Dynamic Metronome aims to be a fully featured metronome. Given that it meets my quality standards, I will release it on the Google Play Store.
